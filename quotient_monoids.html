    <h1>quotient monoids, or how i became universial-algebra-pilled</h1>
    You probably think that the kernel of a map is that which it sends to identity. <br> <br>
    While true for "nice" algebraic structures, like groups, rings, modules, etc., this is not at all true in general.
    The goal of this blog post is to offer the "universial algebra pill" to readers already familiar with blue-pilled algebra but unfamiliar with more exotic structures.
    For those unaware, I am making a pointed analogy to the popular 1999 film <i>The Matrix</i>.
    It contains a pivotal scene in which the main character is offered the choice of the "red pill" or the "blue pill".
    If they take the blue pill, they can return to life as usual, but without knowing the truth of the universe.
    If they take the red pill, they will learn the truth forever and they can never go back to not knowing it.
    Sometimes, learning a key bit of math can feel like having just ingested the red pill.
    It is impossible to see things as naively as one once did.
    So prepare yourself, because if I do my job right, this blog post will pull the wool off your eyes and you will never see kernels the same again.
    (If you already are universial-algebra-pilled, then feel free to laugh at me for how seriously I am taking myself in this introduction.)
    <h2>reframing quotient groups</h2>
    Let's start with the familiar.
    Recall how quotient groups are constructed.
    Well, you may be thinking of normal subgroups and friends right now.
    This is not what we want.
    We want an equivalence relation that respects the group operation.
    Normal subgroups and friends are <i>results</i>, not definitions.
    Let $\sim$ be our equivalence relation over our group $(G, \cdot)$.
    Then we define our equivalence relation to respect $\cdot$ if for all $a, b, c \in G$, <br>
    $a \sim b \rightarrow ca \sim cb$ and $a \sim b \rightarrow ac \sim bc$ <br>
    From there it is possible to prove that cosets constructed via a normal subgroup are precisely these types of equivalence relations.
    However, let's pretend we did not know that.
    Define $G/\sim$ as the partition induced by $\sim$ with G's $\cdot$ remaining as our group operation, but this time applying over cosets.
    This is well-defined because of our equivalence relation's respect for $\cdot$.
    It also induces a natural projection $G \rightarrow G/\sim$ by mapping elements of G onto their cosets.
    Even with this bare-bones treatment of quotient groups, we still have a version of the Homomorphism Theorem!
    (Also known as the First Isomorphism Theorem, or a lot of other names, because this theorem has way too many names.)
    To see why, consider any surjective group homomorphism $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$.
    We can define $\sim$ over $G$ by letting $a \sim b$ iff $\varphi(a) = \varphi(b)$.
    It is quick to verify this is an equivalence relation.
    Critically, $\sim$ also respects $\cdot$; given any $a, b, c \in G$, <br>
    $a \sim b \rightarrow \varphi(a) = \varphi(b) \rightarrow \varphi(c) \varphi(a) = \varphi(c) \varphi(b) \rightarrow \varphi(ca) = \varphi(cb) \rightarrow ca \sim cb$ <br>
    and because $\varphi$ is surjective, for any $h \in H$ there exists at least one $c$ such that $\varphi(c) = h$.
    This, along with the natural reflected argument, proves that $\sim$ respects G's $\cdot$.
    Let's (suggestively) rename $\sim$ to $\ker \varphi$.
    Then we have constructed a natural isomorphism between $G/\ker \varphi$ and $H$!
    (And further, the natural projection mentioned earlier factors through it.)
    <h2>hold on, you called that equivalence relation <i>what?</i></h2>

    <h1>quotient monoids, or how i became universial-algebra-pilled</h1>
    You probably think that the kernel of a map is that which it sends to identity. <br> <br>
    While true for "nice" algebraic structures, like groups, rings, modules, etc., this is not at all true in general.
    The goal of this blog post is to offer the "universial algebra pill" to readers already familiar with blue-pilled algebra but unfamiliar with more exotic structures.
    For those unaware, I am making a pointed analogy to the popular 1999 film <i>The Matrix</i>.
    It contains a pivotal scene in which the main character is offered the choice of the "red pill" or the "blue pill".
    If they take the blue pill, they can return to life as usual, but without knowing the truth of the universe.
    If they take the red pill, they will learn the truth forever and they can never go back to not knowing it.
    Sometimes, learning a key bit of math can feel like having just ingested the red pill.
    It is impossible to see things as naively as one once did.
    So prepare yourself, because if I do my job right, this blog post will pull the wool off your eyes and you will never see kernels the same again.
    (If you already are universial-algebra-pilled, then feel free to laugh at me for how seriously I am taking myself in this introduction.)

      Welcome to Frank Blog, written by <a href="https://discord.com/users/431523235960717322">@keith_ps</a> AKA <a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Keith_J._Bauer">Keith J. Bauer</a>. <br>
      Why is it named Frank Blog? Well—

        Proof that a lattice is distributive if and only if its two natural medians are equal: <a href="https://frank-9976.github.io/median/median.html">https://frank-9976.github.io/median.html</a> <br>
        This is just a quick and dirty proof sketch because I wanted to put the result somewhere and I think it's cool.

        Why n + 1 element sets are rank n simplices: <a href="https://frank-9976.github.io/simplices/simplices.html">https://frank-9976.github.io/simplices.html</a> <br>
        These are a collection of observations I've had about how sets with n + 1 elements have often wanted to be rank n simplices in my experience.
        Now I have a link to share when I want to explain what I mean by this!

        Proof that quasigroup midpoint algebras are averaging operations over Z[1/2]-modules: <a href="https://frank-9976.github.io/midpoint/midpoint.html">https://frank-9976.github.io/midpoint.html</a> <br>
        I literally wrote this just to justify my edit to this page on nlab: <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cancellative+midpoint+algebra">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cancellative+midpoint+algebra</a> <br>
        It's quite beautiful math though, so I am proud of my work here.

        How to take quotients of monoids: <a href="https://frank-9976.github.io/quotient_monoids/quotient_monoids.html">https://frank-9976.github.io/quotient_monoids.html</a> <br>
        If you are not universal-algebra-pilled like me, you might have no idea that this is even a thing.
        This is my attempt to shine a light on this beautiful subject.
        Or more accurately, now I can link this whenever I want to introduce someone to quotient monoids.

        My first blog post: <a href="https://frank-9976.github.io/first_post/first_post.html">https://frank-9976.github.io/first_post.html</a> <br>
        This was the first thing I ever felt the need to make a blog for.
        I don't think I will ever update this but I am keeping it around for sentimental reasons.
        Just keep in mind I regret a few choices I made here.
        After writing the bulk of it, I did find someone who had similar ideas, so here is a link to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02545">his paper</a> because I think it is really cool.
        His paper is also where I found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-314X(87)90032-1">K.R Matthews and G.M Leigh</a>, which in my opinion is a really underrated result about collatz-like problems.

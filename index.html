    <h1>the balanced collatz problem [WIP]</h1>
    <p>
      The collatz problem needs no introduction because it is one of the most infamous problems in the history of mathematics.
      It is so infamous, in fact, that I do not have much serious interest in solving it.
      However, something I found interesting was the fundamental reason why we would <i>expect</i> every orbit to reach 1.
      Let $\alpha = 3$ and $\beta = 2$. The collatz map can be written in this form:<br><br>
      $f(r) = \begin{cases}
      \frac{\alpha r + 1}{\beta} & r \equiv 1 \mod \beta \\
      \frac{r}{\beta} & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}$<br><br>
      The choice to label the independent variable "r" is important because the goal will be to generalize this to specific types of rings, but I should not get ahead of myself.
      The important thing to note is that we can model the "expected value" in change in valuation by assuming there is a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance that any given "even" number will become "odd" when divided by $\beta$.
      However, the current form of the collatz map is inconvenient to our purposes. Let's define an auxiliary function "[]" to assist in a new definition:<br><br>
      $[r] = \frac{r}{\beta^n}, n = \sup(\{n: \beta^n \mid r\})$<br>
      $f(r) = [\alpha r + 1]$<br><br>
      This is often known as the "Syracuse" function. It is essentially the same as the collatz map but its image is odd numbers only; it skips past all the even iterations.
      Using the Syracuse form of the collatz map, we can model the expected valuation increase from one application of this map:<br><br>
      $E = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{v(\alpha) - n v(\beta)}{2^n}$<br><br>
      Note that valuation here is assumed to be a function on $a,b \in R^{\neq 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which satisfies $v(ab) = v(a) + v(b)$.
      For integers, $\log\mid r\mid$ works nicely, but we can extend this to other rings! (Yet again, don't want to get ahead of myself.)
      Anyway, let's find an explicit formula for E:<br><br>
      $ = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{v(\alpha)}{2^n} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{v(\beta)}{2^k} = v(\alpha) - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{v(\beta)}{2^{n-1}} = v(\alpha) - v(2\beta)$<br><br>
      Well, that's a nice formula if I ever saw one! Indeed, $\log(3/4) < 0$, so we expect the collatz conjecture to be true.
      And this is where the title of this post comes from: this formula made me wonder: "can we have a <i>balanced</i> collatz problem such that E = 0?"
      It turns out, we <i>can</i>!

    <h1>the balanced collatz problem [WIP]</h1>
    <p>
      The collatz problem needs no introduction because it is one of the most infamous problems in the history of mathematics.
      It is so infamous, in fact, that I do not have much serious interest in solving it.
      However, something I found interesting was the fundamental reason why we would <i>expect</i> every orbit to reach 1.
      Let $\alpha = 3$ and $\beta = 2$. The collatz map can be written in this form:<br>
      $f(r) = \begin{cases}
      \frac{\alpha r + 1}{\beta} & r \equiv 1 \mod \beta \\
      \frac{r}{\beta} & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}$<br>
      The choice to label the independent variable "r" is important because the goal will be to generalize this to specific types of rings, but I should not get ahead of myself.
      The important thing to note is that we can model the "expected value" in change in valuation by assuming there is a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance that any given "even" number will become "odd" when divided by $\beta$.
      If we valuate integers the natural way, i.e. absolute value, we get the following for odd r:

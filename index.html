    <h1>the balanced collatz problem [Work In Progress]</h1>
    <p>
      The collatz problem needs no introduction because it is one of the most infamous problems in the history of mathematics.
      It is so infamous, in fact, that I do not have much serious interest in solving it.
      However, something I found interesting was the fundamental reason why we would <i>expect</i> every orbit to reach 1.
      Let $\alpha = 3$ and $\beta = 2$. The collatz map can be written in this form:<br><br>
      $f(r) = \begin{cases}
      \frac{\alpha r + 1}{\beta} & r \equiv 1 \mod \beta \\
      \frac{r}{\beta} & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}$<br><br>
      The choice to label the independent variable "r" is important because the goal will be to generalize this to specific types of rings, but I should not get ahead of myself.
      The important thing to note is that we can model the "expected value" in change in valuation by assuming there is a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance that any given "even" number will become "odd" when divided by $\beta$.
      However, the current form of the collatz map is inconvenient to our purposes. Let's define an auxiliary function "[]" to assist in a new definition:<br><br>
      $[r] = \frac{r}{\beta^n}, n = \sup(\{n: \beta^n \mid r\})$<br>
      $f(r) = [\alpha r + 1]$<br><br>
      This is often known as the "Syracuse" function. It is essentially the same as the collatz map but its image is odd numbers only; it skips past all the even iterations.
      Using the Syracuse form of the collatz map, we can model the expected valuation increase from one application of this map:<br><br>
      $E = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{v(\alpha) - n v(\beta)}{2^n}$<br><br>
      Note that valuation here is assumed to be a function on $a,b \in R^{\neq 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which satisfies $v(ab) = v(a) + v(b)$.
      For integers, $\log\mid r\mid$ works nicely, but we can extend this to other rings! (Yet again, don't want to get ahead of myself.)
      Anyway, let's find an explicit formula for E:<br><br>
      $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{v(\alpha) - n v(\beta)}{2^n}
      = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{v(\alpha)}{2^n} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{v(\beta)}{2^k}
      = v(\alpha) - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{v(\beta)}{2^{n-1}} = v(\alpha) - 2v(\beta)$<br><br>
      Well, that's a nice formula if I ever saw one! Indeed, $\log\mid\frac{3}{4}\mid &lt; 0$ so we expect the collatz conjecture to be true.
      And this is where the title of this post comes from! This formula made me wonder: "can we have a <i>balanced</i> collatz problem such that E = 0?"
      It turns out, we <i>can</i>! But not over $\mathbb{Z}$, because we must have two important requirements for $\alpha$ and $\beta$:<br><br>
      $R/(\beta) \cong Z/2Z$<br>
      $\alpha \notin (\beta)$<br><br>
      The first requirement guarantees that $\beta$ splits the ring into "odds" and "evens".
      The second requirement guarantees that $\beta \mid \alpha r + 1$.
      However, given these conditions, it is impossible for $\mathbb{Z}$ to have a "balanced" collatz problem because squares of 2 (or -2) must be even.
      (Note that by the condition on what $v$ should be, given above, $2v(\beta) = v(\beta^2)$.)
      So we must turn to other rings.
      (In fact, they must be integral domains, because we want that there be a unique q such that if $r \in (\beta)$ then $r = \beta q$.
      Otherwise division by $\beta$ is not well-defined.
      Indeed, assume that there exist $q_1$ and $q_2$ such that the above equation holds.
      Then $r - r = \beta (q_1 - q_2) = 0$ and R being an integral domain proves that $q_1 = q_2$.)

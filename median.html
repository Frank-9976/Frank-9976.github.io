    <h1>moral medians</h1>
    The thesis of this blog post will be that a lattice (in the sense of order theory) has a unique concept of a $3$-arity "median" operation if and only if it is distributive.
    I am recording this observation on my blog because I have nowhere better to put it.
    So don't expect a well-written explanatory blog post because this is just quick and dirty.
    <h2>standard definitions</h2>
    A <i>lattice</i> is a set equipped with $\land$ (read: meet) and $\lor$ (read: join) operations that act as "greatest lower bound" and "least upper bound" operations, respectively.
    You can find a precise definition on the internet easily, but it won't be necessary for this blog post anyway, so I won't bother writing it out here.
    The important part is that all lattices have an induced partial order $\leq$ and are often pictographically represented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram">Hasse diagrams</a>, which I <i>will</i> use in this post.
    A lattice is <i>distributive</i> iff $x \land (y \lor z) = (x \land y) \lor (x \land z)$ iff $x \lor (y \land z) = (x \lor y) \land (x \lor z)$
    iff it is isomorphic to a subset of a power set with $\cap$ and $\cup$ as its $\meet$ and $\join$ iff it has no sublattices isomorphic to the $M_3$ or $N_5$ lattice.
    As you can see, they have a lot of different characterizations, the latter of which will be particular relevant for this post.
    <h2>nonstandard definitions</h2>
    Define <br><br>
    $M(x, y, z) := (x \land y) \lor (x \land z) \lor (y \land z)$ <br>
    $M'(x, y, z) := (x \lor y) \land (x \lor z) \land (y \lor z)$ <br>
    <h2>big claim</h2>
    $M(x, y, z) = M'(x, y, z)$ in $(L, \land, \lor)$ if and only if $L$ is distributive.
    <h2>distributive implies $M = M'$</h2>
    The easiest way to see this is to use that distributive lattices have the same equational theory as $(\{0, 1\}, \land, \lor)$ and verify by hand (i.e. use a truth table) that these define the same boolean operations.
    Intuitively, if we view $x, y, z$ as sets, $M(x, y, z)$ is the set of elements in at least two of $x, y, z$, and $M'(x, y, z)$ is a really weird way of saying the same thing.
    (Note that if $L$ is linearly ordered, both $M$ and $M'$ are the $3$-arity "median" operation, as I promised in the title of this post. This is not part of the proof, but I should mention it somewhere.)
    ($\land$ is minimum and $\lor$ is maximum in this specific case.)
    <h2>not distributive implies $M \neq M'$</h2>
    Sublattices preserve lattice operations, so we just need to show that this is true of $M_3$ and $N_5$. $M_3$ first: <br>
    <img src="/M3.png"> <br>
    We have that $M(x, y, z) = 0$ but $M'(x, y, z) = 1$. $N_5$ next: <br>
    <img src="/N5.png"> <br>
    We have that $M(x, y, z) = x$ but $M'(x, y, z) = y$.
    <h2>gg keith, so what</h2>
    Honestly, I don't really have a moral of the story here. I just think this is a cool fact, so I wanted to write it up. Bye!!

    <h1>cancellative midpoint algebras = Z[1/2]-modules</h1>
    I have edited an nlab article while putting the source as, essentially, "trust me, bro."
    Because of this, I figure I should create the source that I will cite before the people at nlab get mad at me.
    The goal of this blog post is to demonstrate that a cancellative midpoint algebra induces a unique Z[1/2]-module up to isomorphism, and vice versa.
    <h2>what is a cancellative midpoint algebra</h2>
    A midpoint algebra is a set and binary operation $(M, \mid)$ such that <br><br>
    $a \mid a = a$ (idempotent) <br>
    $a \mid b = b \mid a$ (commutative) <br>
    $(a \mid b) \mid (c \mid d) = (a \mid c) \mid (b \mid d)$ ("medial") <br><br>
    The medial axiom may look really arbitrary but it underpins two very important facts.
    One comes up later, but an immediate consequence is that midpoint algebras are self-distributive, by letting b = a: <br><br>
    $(a \mid a) \mid (c \mid d) = (a \mid c) \mid (a \mid d)$ (medial) <br>
    $(a \mid a) \mid (c \mid d) = a \mid (c \mid d)$ (idempotent) <br>
    $a \mid (c \mid d) = (a \mid c) \mid (a \mid d)$ (equality is transitive) <br><br>
    In general, this is a very useful property.
    Now, a cancellative midpoint algebra is typically defined by an implication statement resulting in the cancelation property.
    However, an equivalent and often more convenient formulation introduces a new operation, which I will deonte with $/$, that obeys the following property: <br><br>
    $(a \mid b) / b = a$ (cancellation 1) <br>
    $(a / b) \mid b = a$ (cancellation 2) <br><br>
    Essentially, this upgrades our algebra from a magma to a "quasigroup".
    Typically, quasigroups are defined with both a left- and right-division, but we can avoid this because our operation is commutative.
    Something that will be useful is that we can prove $\mid$ also distributes over $/$: <br><br>
    $a \mid b = a \mid b$ (equality is reflexive) <br>
    $a \mid ((b / c) \mid c) = a \mid b$ (cancellation 2) <br>
    $(a \mid (b / c)) \mid (a \mid c) = a \mid b$ (self-distributive) <br>
    $a \mid (b / c) = (a \mid b) / (a \mid c)$ (divide both sides by $(a \mid c)$) <br><br>
    Now we have the basics to get into the proof.
    <h2>motivation for what follows</h2>
    We are motivated by the observation that any Z[1/2]-module induces a unique cancellative midpoint algebra.
    Indeed, let our module be denoted $(A, +)$.
    (The letter A is suggestive of how this is just an abelian group equipped with a sensible "halving" operation.
    Also the letter M was taken because M stands for Midpoint.)
    Then we can define $a \mid b = \frac{a + b}{2}$ and $a / b = 2a - b$.
    It is trivial to verify these obey each axiom of a cancellative midpoint algebra listed above.
    Our goal will be to uniquely reconstruct $(A, +)$ given $(M, \mid, /)$.
    <h2>the proof</h2>
    Given a cancellative midpoint algebra $(M, \mid, /)$, choose an arbitrary element $z \in M$ and define: <br><br>
    $a + b = (a \mid b) / z$ <br>
    $-a = z / a$
    $\frac{a}{2} = z \mid a$ <br><br>
    I call this element "z" because it will act as 0 (zero) in our constructed Z[1/2]-module.
    It turns out that regardless of what z you pick, the result is always the same up to isomorphism.
    This is because left-multiplication by $z' / z$ is a cancellative midpoint algebra automorphism that sends $z$ to $z'$ for any $z'$ we desire.
    This is part of why I verified above that $\mid$ distributes over both itself and division; this is sufficient to prove this is a valid endomorphism.
    Then right-division by $z' / z$ is a two-sided inverse and thus proves it is in fact an automorphism.
    However, we need right-division to be distributive and thus an endomorphism in order for this logic to work.
    The proof is as follows: <br><br>
    $a \mid b = a \mid b$ (equality is transitive) <br>
    $a \mid b = (((a / c) \ mid c) \mid ((b / c) \mid c))$ (cancellation 2) <br>
    $a \mid b = ((a / c) \mid (b / c)) \mid c$ (self-distributive) <br>
    $(a \mid b) / c = (a / c) \mid (b / c)$ (divide both sides by c) <br><br>
    Well, we also need to show it distributes over division, but that's easy enough.
    $a / b = a / b$ (equality is transitive) <br>
    $a / b = ((a \mid c) / c) / ((b \mid c) / c)$ (cancellation 1) <br>
    $a / b = ((a \mid c) / (c \mid c)) / ((b \mid c) / (c \mid c))$ (idempotent) <br>
    $a / b = ((a / c) / (b / c)) \mid c$ (self-distributive) <br>
    $(a / b) / c = (a / c) / (b / c)$ (divide both sides by c) <br><br>
    With that out of the way, we can proceed without fear even though z was an arbitrary choice!
    We can mindlessly verify quite a few abelian group axioms to start.
    It is obvious that $a + b = b + a$.
    A moment's thought reveals that $a + z = a$ by cancellation of z.
    $a - a = z$ is slightly less trivial: <br><br>
    $a - a = (a \mid (z / a)) / z = z / z = z$ <br><br>
    Note that $z / z = z$ follows from dividing both sides of $z \mid z = z$ by z.
    Our penultimate obstacle is our greatest one yet: associativity of $+$.
    Until now, we have not used mediality outside of its self-distributive consequences.
    Essentially, everything above applies to what are known as "commutative quandles".
    It is, in fact, impossible to prove the following fact without mediality, because there exist commutative quandles that are the result of a midpoint operation over commutative moufang loops, which are not associative. <br><br>
    $(z \mid a) \mid (b \mid c) = (z \mid a) \mid (b \mid c)$ (equality is reflexive) <br>
    $(z \mid a) \mid (b \mid c) = (z \mid a) \mid (c \mid b)$ (commutative) <br>
    $(z \mid a) \mid (b \mid c) = (z \mid c) \mid (a \mid b)$ (<b>medial!!</b>) <br>
    $a \mid ((b \mid c) / z) = c \mid ((a \mid b) / z)$ (divide both sizes by z, right-division distributing) <br>
    $(a \mid ((b \mid c) / z)) / z = (c \mid ((a \mid b) / z)) / z$ (divide both sides by z, right-division distributing) <br>
    $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$ (definition) <br><br>
    And there we go!
    All that is left to show is that we have a sensible action by $\frac{1}{2}$ on this abelian group, which is refreshingly simple:
    $\frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2} = ((z \mid a) \mid (z \mid a)) / z = (z \mid a) / z = a$ as desired.
    <h2>QED!</h2>
    I am sure that Peter Freyd already is aware of this, but hey, I can't find this fact elsewhere online, so might as well do it myself.
    Also, I often say that I enjoy maths because it's one big unending puzzle, and this is honestly the perfect example of that.
    It was really fun to piece everything together :)

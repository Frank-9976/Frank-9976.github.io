    <h1>cancellative midpoint algebras = Z[1/2]-modules</h1>
    I have edited an nlab article while putting the source as, essentially, "trust me, bro."
    Because of this, I figure I should create the source that I will cite before the people at nlab get mad at me.
    <h2>what is a cancellative midpoint algebra</h2>
    A midpoint algebra is a set and binary operation $(M, \mid)$ such that <br><br>
    $a \mid a = a$ (idempotent) <br>
    $a \mid b = b \mid a$ (commutative) <br>
    $(a \mid b) \mid (c \mid d) = (a \mid c) \mid (b \mid d)$ ("medial") <br><br>
    The medial axiom may look really arbitrary but it underpins two very important facts.
    One comes up later, but an immediate consequence is that midpoint algebras are self-distributive, by letting b = a: <br><br>
    $(a \mid a) \mid (c \mid d) = (a \mid c) \mid (a \mid d)$ (medial) <br>
    $(a \mid a) \mid (c \mid d) = a \mid (c \mid d)$ (idempotent) <br>
    $a \mid (c \mid d) = (a \mid c) \mid (a \mid d)$ (equality is transitive) <br><br>
    In general, this is a very useful property.
    Now, a cancellative midpoint algebra is typically defined by an implication statement resulting in the cancelation property.
    However, an equivalent and often more convenient formulation introduces a new operation, which I will deonte with $/$, that obeys the following property: <br><br>
    $(a \mid b) / b = a$ (cancellation 1) <br>
    $(a / b) \mid b = a$ (cancellation 2) <br><br>
    Essentially, this upgrades our algebra from a magma to a "quasigroup".
    Typically, quasigroups are defined with both a left- and right-division, but we can avoid this because our operation is commutative.
    Something that will be useful is that we can prove $\mid$ also distributes over $/$: <br><br>
    $a \mid b = a \mid b$ (equality is reflexive) <br>
    $a \mid ((b / c) \mid c) = a \mid b$ (cancellation 2) <br>
    $(a \mid (b / c)) \mid (a \mid c) = a \mid b$ (self-distributive) <br>
    $a \mid (b / c) = (a \mid b) / (a \mid c)$ (divide both sides by $(a \mid c)$) <br><br>
    Okay at this point I'm going to save my progress and see if this page looks good so far.
